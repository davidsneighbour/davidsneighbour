## Corona Sucks!

I had a very early insight into what Corona will do to businesses around the world. In late December 2019 I read about a weird new virus that came up on a wet market somewhere in China and immediately felt like the movie "Contagion" came true. Some weeks later in late January I felt that this was slightly bigger than assumed before. Turn your clocks to now and you will know, how this little bat-induced virus affected us all. 

I have extensive experience in "making the best out of this situation". My customers were mostly companies that served tourist and travellers here on Koh Samui in Thailand. Thailand completely closed down for tourists in late March. I helped my customers (tour companies and hotels/resorts) to stay afloat through the pandemic and find new business opportunities and customer groups. 

If you think I can help you feel free to contact me!

## [BooKa](https://github.com/getbooka)

I am working on a project called BooKa. It's what the Germans call "eierlegende Wollmilchsau" (egg laying wool milk pork), basically a tool or service that does everything for a certain part of a business. Right now we support small and medium businesses on Koh Samui to do what they do. Be it Hotels, Resorts, Tour companies, Cafes, Restaurants, Shops. We offer online available booking systems, reporting and management of bookings and sales reporting systems. The software is proprietary at the moment, but we expect it to be open source in a while.

## [Colossus WP](https://github.com/colossus-wp)

I have a long history of working with WordPress themes and plugins and recently took over the long abandoned Titan Framework, an options framework for WordPress. My goal is to make this library available for the latest versions of WordPress and enable everyone to add options and setup pages to their plugins and themes. 

## Hugo

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is in action in more than half of all websites I am working on (my own and my customer's). It's fast, it's flexible and it produces websites.

I am pretty active on the [Hugo Discourse Forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io):
