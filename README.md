## BooKa

I am working on a project called BooKa. It's what the Germans call "eierlegende Wollmilchsau" (egg laying wool milk pork), basically a tool or service that does everything for a certain part of a business. Right now we support small and medium businesses on Koh Samui to do what they do. Be it Hotels, Resorts, Tour companies, Cafes, Restaurants, Shops. We offer online available booking systems, reporting and management of bookings and sales reporting systems. The software is proprietary at the moment, but we expect it to be open source in a while.
